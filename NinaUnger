My Assumptions:
I worked with the wordpress default theme twentytwenty, and decided to not create a child theme for this task.
I created the wordpress database wp-test-schema. the default setup did not let me use "root" for the password. so i left it blank.(i could change it through the table)

Files I created/changed:

1. I created a new php file named pubPlus.php
this file is for the plugin.
I located it in a new pubPlus plugin folder
..\wordpress\wp-content\plugins\pubPlus\pubPlus.php
2.I created a javascript file named getQueryStringParameter.js
..\wordpress\wp-content\themes\twentytwenty\assets\js\getQueryStringParameter.js
3.I modified the style.css theme file
C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\twentytwenty\style.css
